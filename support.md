 ## Frequently asked questions

- **How do I know if I am eligible for this initiative?**

    Weâ€™ve built a service for you to check if youâ€™re [eligible](/eligibility.md) for the Product Development Tools. You can check it out here: [**go.gov.sg/product-dev-tools-eligibility**](https://go.gov.sg/product-dev-tools-eligibility)
    
    Alternatively, you can reach our initiative team via Slack at the [**#feedback-product-development-tools**](https://govtech.enterprise.slack.com/archives/C07UF60HY9Y) channel to find out more. Please note that this initiative is currently a pilot for selected roles and teams in GovTech.

- **What is the Product Development Tools initiative?**

    The Product Development Tools initiative is designed to provide eligible GovTechies (e.g., Product Managers, Engineers, Designers) with centrally funded licenses for selected development tools, such as GitLab, Jira, and Confluence. Instead of individual teams or projects managing separate tool licenses, GovTech will centrally cover the costs, simplifying access to essential tools for eligible roles. More details on the tools covered will be shared as the rollout progresses.

- **What should I do if I am a GovTechie but donâ€™t have a SHIP-HATS subscription?**

    To qualify for the Product Development Tools initiative, you need to be in an eligible role from the teams selected for the pilot. If you do not have an existing SHIP-HATS subscription, you will automatically be assigned license(s) according to your role. For subscription accounts with eligible GovTechies, the licenses for GitLab, Jira and Confluence assigned to them will be moved out of the existing account into a central GovTech account.

- **If Iâ€™m a GovTechie in an eligible role, will I automatically get access to the centrally funded tools?**

    During this pilot phase, only eligible roles (e.g., Engineer, Product Manager, Designer) within selected teams will be offered access to the centrally funded tools. Specific instructions on access and eligibility criteria will be communicated directly to those chosen for the pilot. Please stay tuned for further details as we roll out this initiative.

- **As part of this transition, will there be updates to my subscription accounts?**

    During this transition, some TechBiz subscription accounts will be updated as licensed users are moved to a centrally managed GovTech subscription. Subscription Admins (SAs) need to be aware that not all subscriptions will be affected but licenses assigned in your accounts will be reduced when users are transferred. A separate communication will be sent to affected SAs with detailed information on any changes.

- **Will there be any impact on the cost of SHIP-HATS subscriptions due to this initiative?**

    Yes, there will be an impact on costs for some SHIP-HATS subscriptions, particularly for eligible GovTechies whose tools are now covered under the Product Development Tools initiative. For these users, the charges will no longer be incurred by their previous subscription accounts, and the subscription plans for those accounts will be adjusted (down) accordingly to prevent duplicate charges. However, SHIP-HATS as a product will continue to follow its existing subscription and pricing model for all other users, including external agencies.

- **Are contractors eligible for the Product Development Tools initiative?**

    Vendors and augmented staff (in any role) from Bulk Tender 19024, 23069, or 23009 are not eligible for this initiative. The centrally funded product development tools are available only to GovTech permanent and contract staff in eligible roles.

- **Will the initiative affect the SHIP-HATS subscription model for government agencies outside of GovTech?**

    No, this initiative is specific to GovTechies and does not affect the SHIP-HATS subscription model for other government agencies. Government agencies using SHIP-HATS will continue to subscribe under the existing pricing model, and the Product Development Tools initiative is only applicable to eligible roles within GovTech.

- **Does this initiative cover all SHIP-HATS tools?**

    No, this initiative does not cover all SHIP-HATS tools. It only includes selected toolsâ€”specifically GitLab, Jira, and Confluenceâ€”that are part of SHIP-HATS and used for product development. These tools will be centrally funded for eligible roles in GovTech, but SHIP-HATS, as a whole, will continue under its existing subscription and pricing model.

- **Are SHIP-HATS tools going to be free?**

    No, SHIP-HATS tools will not be available for free. This initiative will centralise the management of access to Product Development Tools but will only apply to eligible GovTechies. SHIP-HATS will continue to operate under its existing subscription and pricing model.
