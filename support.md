 ## FAQs

- **What should I do if I am a GovTechie but donâ€™t have a SHIP-HATS subscription?**

    To qualify for the centrally funded tools under this initiative, you need to be in an eligible role. If you do not have an existing SHIP-HATS subscription, you will automatically be assigned license(s) according to your role. For Subscription Admins with eligible GovTechies, the licenses for eligible tools assigned to them will be moved out of your account into a central account.



- **If Iâ€™m a GovTechie in an eligible role, will I automatically get access to the centrally funded tools?**

    No, access will not be automatic. During this pilot phase, only eligible roles (e.g., Engineer, Product Manager, Designer) within selected teams will be offered access to the centrally funded tools. Specific instructions on access and eligibility criteria will be communicated directly to those chosen for the pilot. Please stay tuned for further details as we roll out this initiative.



- **As part of this transition, will there be any updates to my subscription accounts?**

    During this transition, some subscription accounts may be adjusted to align with role eligibility under the Centrally Funded Product Development Tools initiative. Subscription Admins (SAs) should be aware that while not all subscriptions will be affected, certain updates may be implemented to reflect the new eligibility structure. A separate communication will be sent to affected SAs with detailed information on any changes.

- **Will there be any impact on the cost of SHIP-HATS subscriptions due to this initiative?**

    Yes, there will be an impact on costs for some SHIP-HATS subscriptions, particularly for eligible GovTechies whose tools are now covered under the Centrally Funded Product Development Tools initiative. For these users, the charges will no longer be incurred by their previous subscription accounts, and the subscription plans for those accounts will be adjusted (down) accordingly to prevent duplicate charges. However, SHIP-HATS as a product will continue to follow its existing subscription and pricing model for all other users, including external agencies.

- **Are contractors eligible for the Centrally Funded Product Development Tools initiative?**

    No, contractorsâ€”including those hired under Bulk Tender 19024 or 23009â€”are not eligible for this initiative. The centrally funded product development tools are available only to full-time GovTech staff in eligible roles.

- **Will the initiative affect the SHIP-HATS subscription model for government agencies outside of GovTech?**

    No, this initiative is specific to GovTechies and does not affect the SHIP-HATS subscription model for other government agencies. Government agencies using SHIP-HATS will continue to subscribe under the existing pricing model, and the Centrally Funded Product Development Tools initiative is only applicable to eligible roles within GovTech.

- **Does this initiative cover all SHIP-HATS tools?**

    No, this initiative does not cover all SHIP-HATS tools. It only includes selected toolsâ€”specifically GitLab, Jira, and Confluenceâ€”that are part of SHIP-HATS and used for product development. These tools will be centrally funded for eligible roles in GovTech, but SHIP-HATS as a whole will continue under its existing subscription and pricing model.

- **What is the Centrally Funded Product Development Tools initiative?**

    The Centrally Funded Product Development Tools initiative is designed to provide eligible GovTechies (e.g., Product Managers, Engineers, Designers) with centrally funded licenses for selected development tools, such as GitLab, Jira, and Confluence. Instead of individual teams or projects managing separate tool licenses, GovTech will centrally cover the costs, simplifying access to essential tools for eligible roles. More details on the tools covered will be shared as the rollout progresses.

- **How do I get SHIP-HATS tools for free?**

    SHIP-HATS tools are not offered for free. However, if youâ€™re a GovTechie in an eligible role (such as Product Manager, Engineer, or Designer), you may qualify for access to centrally funded licenses for selected tools through GovTechâ€™s Centrally Funded Product Development Tools initiative.

- **Are SHIP-HATS tools going to be free?**

    No, SHIP-HATS tools will not be available for free. GovTech will cover the cost of specific product development tools under the Centrally Funded Product Development Tools initiative, but this only applies to eligible GovTech staff (GovTechies). SHIP-HATS itself will continue to operate under its existing subscription and pricing model.
