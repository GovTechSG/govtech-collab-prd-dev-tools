 ## FAQs

 -  **If Iâ€™m a GovTechie in an eligible role, will I instantly get access to the centrally funded tools?**

    During the pilot phase, access will be rolled out progressively to eligible roles (e.g., Engineer, Product Manager, Designer) in selected teams. Specific details on access and eligibility criteria will be shared with those chosen for the pilot.

    Stay tuned for further updates as the initiative is rolled out.

- **What should I do if I am a GovTechie but donâ€™t have a SHIP-HATS subscription?**

    To qualify for the centrally funded tools under this initiative, you need to be in an eligible role. If you do not have an existing SHIP-HATS subscription, you will automatically be assigned licenses based on your role.
    
    For Subscription Admins with eligible GovTechies, the licenses for eligible tools assigned to them will be transferred to a central account.


- **As part of this transition, will there be any updates to my subscription accounts?**

    During this transition, some subscription accounts may be updated to align with role eligibility under the Centrally Funded Product Development Tools initiative. 

    Subscription Admins (SAs) should be aware that while not all subscriptions will be affected, certain updates may be implemented to reflect the new eligibility structure. A separate communication will be sent to affected SAs with detailed information on any changes.

- **Will there be any impact on the cost of SHIP-HATS subscriptions due to this initiative?**

    For eligible GovTechies whose tools are now covered under the Centrally Funded Product Development Tools initiative, the charges will no longer be incurred by their previous subscription accounts, and the subscription plans for those accounts will be adjusted (down) accordingly to prevent duplicate charges. 
    
    However, SHIP-HATS as a product will continue to follow its existing subscription and pricing model for all other users, including external agencies.

- **Are contractors eligible for the Centrally Funded Product Development Tools initiative?**

    No, contractorsâ€”including those hired under Bulk Tender 19024 or 23009â€”are not eligible for this initiative. This initiative is only available to full-time GovTech staff in eligible roles.

- **Will the initiative affect the SHIP-HATS subscription model for government agencies outside of GovTech?**

    No, this initiative is specific to eligible GovTechies, and does not affect the SHIP-HATS subscription model for other government agencies. Government agencies using SHIP-HATS will continue to subscribe under the existing pricing model.

- **Does this initiative cover all SHIP-HATS tools?**

    No, this initiative does not cover all SHIP-HATS tools. It only includes selected toolsâ€”specifically GitLab, Jira, and Confluenceâ€”that are part of SHIP-HATS and used for product development. Refer to [Eligibility](/eligibility.md) for more details.
