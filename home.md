# Product Development Tools Pilot Initiative

The Product Development Tools Initiative aims to simplify and centralise access to essential development tools for GovTech product teams, streamlining workflows and reducing barriers to productivity..

Launching in FY24, these tools will be made available to eligible GovTechies upon onboarding, reducing delays and allowing teams to focus on their core task of building impactful products.

This initiative is centrally funded and led by the CIO Office and the Core Engineering Productivity teams, in partnership with [Open Access](https://docs.developer.tech.gov.sg/docs/open-data-access/). 

## What is changing?

Eligible GovTechies will be moved to a Central GovTech subscription for **Product Development Tools** such as GitLab, Jira, and Confluence. This subscription will be managed centrally through automation for GovTechies in eligible roles. 

This is a pilot initiative scoped to the Product Development teams within GovTech.

## What are the benefits?

The overall goal is to enable GovTech engineers to focus on core engineering activities by centralising the planning and procurement of development tools.

- **Centralised provisioning** 

    The CIO Office will handle all tool provisioning, so product teams can focus on core engineering activities rather than dealing with procurement procedures.

- **Enhanced productivity**

    By standardising tools across all product teams, onboarding time is reduced and we  eliminate the need for team members to adapt to different tools when transitioning between teams.


- **Optimised costs** 

    A consolidated procurement approach allows GovTech to benefit from cost savings via bulk purchasing, resulting in more efficient use of resources.

- **Standardisation of tools** 

    A unified set of development tools ensures a smooth, consistent experience for all eligible roles, improving collaboration and productivity across teams.
