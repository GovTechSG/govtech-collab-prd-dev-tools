# Product Development Tools

The Product Development Tools initiative aims to simplify and centralise access to essential development tools for GovTech product teams, streamlining workflows, and reducing barriers to productivity.

Launching in FY24, these tools will be made available to eligible GovTechies upon onboarding, enabling teams to focus on  building impactful products.

This initiative is centrally funded and led by the CIO Office and the Core Engineering Productivity teams, in partnership with [Open Data Access](https://docs.developer.tech.gov.sg/docs/open-data-access/). 

## What are the benefits?

The goal is to enable GovTech engineers to focus on core engineering activities by centralising the planning, procurement, and distribution of tools for product development.

- **Centralised provisioning** 

    The CIO Office will handle all tool provisioning, so product teams can focus on delivering products and value rather than dealing with procurement processes.

- **Enhanced productivity**

    By standardising tools across all product teams, onboarding time is reduced and developers need not adapt to different tools when transitioning between teams.


- **Optimised costs** 

    A consolidated procurement approach allows GovTech to benefit from cost savings via bulk purchasing, resulting in more efficient use of resources.

- **Standardisation of tools** 

    A unified set of development tools ensures a smooth, consistent experience for all eligible roles, improving collaboration and productivity across teams.

## What is changing?

GovTechies used to subscribe via TechBiz to get access to product development tools such as GitLab, Jira and Confluence. With this initiative to centralise Product Development Tools, [eligible  GovTechies](/eligibility.md) will be moved into a Central GovTech subscription managed by CIO office. This subscription will be managed via automation, enabling new GovTechies in eligible roles to have default access to these tools from the day they onboard.

GovTechies who are existing subscribers will be moved to a Central GovTech subscription for **Product Development Tools (GitLab, Jira, and Confluence)**, while GovTechies who are not existing subscribers will be granted access to these tools to support their product development work. Only GovTechies in eligilble roles and teams would be part of this initiative during the pilot rollout.

While we would have loved to extend this to all GovTechies, weâ€™re rolling out the initial pilot for Product Development teams within GovTech.
