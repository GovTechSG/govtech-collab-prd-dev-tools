# Product Development Tools Initiative

The Product Development Tools Initiative is a centrally funded initiative led by the CIO Office and the Core Engineering Productivity teams, in partnership with [Open Access](https://docs.developer.tech.gov.sg/docs/open-data-access/). 

Launching its pilot phase in FY24, it aims to streamline and centralise the provision of essential product development tools by introducing a standardised suite of tools for eligible roles within GovTech product teams. These tools will be made available to eligible GovTechies upon onboarding, reducing delays and allowing teams to focus on their core task of building impactful products.

## What are the benefits?

This initiative aims to implement a centralised approach to tool procurement, with the following key benefits:

- **Centralised provisioning:** The CIO Office will manage tool provisioning, allowing product teams to focus on core competencies instead of procurement procedures.

- **Standardisation of tools:** A consistent set of development tools will be available for all eligible roles, providing a seamless experience across teams.

- **Enhanced productivity:** Standardising tools across product teams facilitates seamless transitions between teams and reduces adaptation time for GovTechies.


- **Optimised costs:** A consolidated procurement approach will  enable GovTech to benefit from cost savings through bulk purchasing.

The overall goal is to enable GovTech engineers to focus on core engineering activities by centralising the planning and procurement of development tools.
