# Product Development Tools Pilot Initiative

The Product Development Tools Initiative aims to simplify and centralize access to essentional development tools for GovTech product teams.

Launching in FY24, these tools will be made available to eligible GovTechies upon onboarding, reducing delays and allowing teams to focus on their core task of building impactful products.

This initiative is centrally funded and led by the CIO Office and the Core Engineering Productivity teams, in partnership with [Open Access](https://docs.developer.tech.gov.sg/docs/open-data-access/). 

## What is changing?

Eligible GovTechies will be moved to a Central GovTech subscription for **Product Development Tools** such as GitLab, Jira, and Confluence. This subscription will be managed centrally through automation for GovTechies who fall within the eligible roles. 

This is a pilot initiative scoped to the Product Development teams in GovTech.

## What are the benefits?

The overall goal is to enable GovTech engineers to focus on core engineering activities by centralising the planning and procurement of development tools.

- **Centralised provisioning** 

    The CIO Office will manage tool provisioning, allowing product teams to focus on core competencies instead of procurement procedures.

- **Enhanced productivity**

    Standardising tools across product teams facilitates seamless transitions between teams and reduces adaptation time for GovTechies.

- **Optimised costs** 

    A consolidated procurement approach will  enable GovTech to benefit from cost savings through bulk purchasing.

- **Standardisation of tools** 

    A consistent set of development tools will be available for all eligible roles, providing a seamless experience across teams.
