# Roadmap

The Free Access Initiative is an evolving program designed to meet the changing needs of GovTech staff. Below, we outline our high-level roadmap for the coming year. 

Please note that these priorities are subject to change based on feedback and organisational needs.

## 2025 Q1

Our primary focus for the first quarter of 2025 will be to:

- Measure the effectiveness of the Free Access Initiative
- Gather and analyse user feedback
- Identify areas for improvement and expansion

## 2025 Q2

Building on our Q1 findings, we plan to:

- Introduce Figma to our suite of free-access tools
- Implement an AI Coding Assistant to boost productivity
- Consider expanding the initiative's scope to include additional groups and roles, based on Q1 effectiveness measurements
