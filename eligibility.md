## How do I know if I am eligible?

We’ve built a service for you to check if you’re eligible for the Product Development Tools. You can check it out here [link to app]. Alternatively, you can reach our initiative team via Slack at the  [**#feedback-product-development-tools**](https://govtech.enterprise.slack.com/archives/C07UF60HY9Y) channel to find out more.

## What do I need to do?

For existing subscribers, the transition is seamless and access to tools are not affected. The subscription admins will receive email notifications from TechBiz about changes (e.g. team members removed from your subscription to be transferred to a central GovTech subscription).

For GovTechies who are not existing subscribers, you may be required to [setup Microsoft MFA](https://docs.developer.tech.gov.sg/docs/techpass-user-guide/sign-up-and-onboard-to-techpass?id=step-2-configure-multi-factor-authentication-mfa-for-wog-account) for TechPass to access these tools. For more details, refer to [TechPass documentation](https://docs.developer.tech.gov.sg/docs/techpass-user-guide/sign-up-and-onboard-to-techpass).
 
Once done, you can start using these Product Development tools:
- [GitLab](https://sgts.gitlab-dedicated.com/) 
- [Jira](https://sgtechstack.atlassian.net/jira)
- [Confluence](https://confluence.ship.gov.sg/)
