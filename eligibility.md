# Eligibility and subscription


The following roles are eligible for centrally-funded access to specific development tools:

Eligible Roles | Tool
|---|---|
| Engineers | GitLab
| Product Managers<br>Engineers<br>Designers | Jira<br>Confluence|


?> **Important:** Please note that contractors (in any role) are not eligible.

## Subscription accounts

If you do not have an existing SHIP-HATS subscription, you will automatically be assigned license(s) according to your role. 

For Subscription Admins with eligible GovTechies, the licenses for eligible tools assigned to them will be moved out of your account into a central account.

As part of this transition, some subscription accounts may be updated based on role eligibility. Subscription Admins (SAs) should note that not all subscriptions will be affected, but certain changes may occur to align with the new eligibility structure.
