# Eligibility and subscription

To qualify for the centrally funded tools under this initiative, you need to be in an eligible role and have a valid SHIP-HATS subscription.

## Who is eligible?

The following roles are eligible for centrally funded access to specific development tools:

- GitLab: Engineers
- Jira + Confluence: Product Managers, Engineers, and Designers
- Figma: Designers

?> **Important:** Please note that contractors (in any role) from Bulk Tender 19024 or 23009 are not eligible.

## Subscription accounts

To qualify for the centrally funded tools under this initiative, you need to have a valid SHIP-HATS subscription and be in an eligible role. If you don’t currently have a SHIP-HATS subscription but believe it’s necessary for your work, please speak with your manager about obtaining access.



As part of this transition, some subscription accounts may be updated based on role eligibility. Subscription Admins (SAs) should note that not all subscriptions will be affected, but certain changes may occur to align with the new eligibility structure.
