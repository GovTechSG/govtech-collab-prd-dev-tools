# Eligibility and subscription

The following roles are eligible for centrally funded access to specific development tools:

| Eligible Roles | Tool(s) |
|---|---|
| Engineers | GitLab |
| Product Managers<br>Engineers<br>Designers | Jira<br>Confluence |


?> **Important:** Contractors (in any role) are not eligible for centrally funded access.

## Subscription accounts

If you do not already have a SHIP-HATS subscription, you will automatically be assigned license(s) for the tools relevant to your role.

For Subscription Admins (SAs), please note that any licenses for eligible tools assigned to GovTechies will be moved from your account to a central account.

As part of this transition, some subscription accounts may be updated according to role eligibility. SAs should be aware that while not all subscriptions will be affected, some changes may be made to align with the new eligibility structure.
