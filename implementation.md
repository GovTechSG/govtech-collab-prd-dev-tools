 # Implementation timelines
 
 ## Pilot Phase I

The pilot will run for one year and targets specific roles within GovTech. During this period, tool usage will be monitored and findings will be reported and evaluated. If certain tools remain inactive, unused subscriptions will be disabled to maintain cost efficiency.

During the pilot phase, only selected teams within eligible roles (e.g., Engineer, Product Manager, Designer) and with valid SHIP-HATS subscriptions will be offered access to the centrally funded tools. Specific instructions on access and eligibility criteria will be communicated directly to those chosen for the pilot. 

Please stay tuned for further details as we roll out this initiative.

## Pilot Phase II

The initiative will be open to more eligible users and organisations by around Q2 of CY25. ?
