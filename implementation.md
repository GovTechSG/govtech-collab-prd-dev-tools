 # Implementation

 ## Pilot period

 During the one-year pilot period, tool usage will be closely monitored, and findings will be reported and evaluated. If certain tools are found to be inactive or underused, unused subscriptions will be deactivated to maintain cost efficiency.

Access will be rolled out progressively to [eligible roles](/eligibility.md) (e.g., Engineer, Product Manager, Designer) across selected teams. Detailed information on access and eligibility will be provided to those selected for the pilot.

Stay tuned for further updates as we continue to roll out the initiative.

## Subscription accounts

As part of this transition, some subscription accounts may be updated according to role eligibility. SAs should be aware that while not all subscriptions will be affected, some changes may be made to align with the new eligibility structure.

For Subscription Admins (SAs), please note that any licenses for eligible tools assigned to GovTechies will be moved from your account to a central account.

If you do not already have a SHIP-HATS subscription, you will automatically be assigned license(s) for the tools relevant to your role.
