 # Pilot implementation

The pilot will run for one year, starting at the end of FY24. During this period, tool usage will be closely monitored, and findings will be reported and evaluated. If certain tools are found to be inactive or underused, unused subscriptions will be deactivated to maintain cost efficiency.

Access will be rolled out progressively to [eligible roles](/eligibility.md) (e.g., Engineer, Product Manager, Designer) across selected teams. Detailed information on access and eligibility will be provided to those selected for the pilot.

Stay tuned for further updates as we continue to roll out the initiative.
