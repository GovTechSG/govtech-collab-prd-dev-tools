 # Pilot implementation

The pilot will run for one year, starting from end FY24. During this period, tool usage will be monitored and findings will be reported and evaluated. If certain tools remain inactive, unused subscriptions will be disabled to maintain cost efficiency.

During the pilot phase, only selected teams within [eligible roles](/eligibility.md) (e.g., Engineer, Product Manager, Designer) will be offered access to the centrally funded tools. Specific instructions on access and eligibility criteria will be communicated directly to those chosen for the pilot. 

Please stay tuned for further details as we roll out this initiative.
