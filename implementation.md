# Implementation

## How will this pilot work?

This pilot will run for one year and target specific roles within GovTech. 

During this period, we will closely monitor tool usage and report findings to the GovTech management to ensure the initiative’s success and optimise costs. If certain tools remain inactive, we’ll evaluate and adjust by disabling unused subscriptions to maintain cost efficiency.

## What do you need to do?

**No action is required.** If you're eligible for this initiative, access will be provided **automatically**. Refer to [Eligible Roles and Tools](/eligibility.md) for more information on eligibility.

If something unexpected happens, please reach out to us via Slack at the [**#feedback-product-development-tools**](https://govtech.enterprise.slack.com/archives/C07UF60HY9Y) channel. We expect the change to be transparent to all and you will continue to have access to your SGTS tools (GitLab, Jira, and Confluence).

## What is the impact to the subscription? 

As part of this transition, some subscription accounts may be updated based on role eligibility. Subscription Admins (SAs) should note that some subscriptions will be adjusted (down) to prevent duplicate charges. There will be a separate communication to convey the changes to the affected SAs.

?> SAs, please note that any licenses for eligible tools assigned to GovTechies will be moved from your account to a central GovTech  account.

If you do not already have a SHIP-HATS subscription, you will automatically be assigned license(s) for the tools relevant to your role.
