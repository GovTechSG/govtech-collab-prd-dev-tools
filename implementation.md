 # This is a Pilot Initiative

During the pilot period from Dec 2024 to Mar 2026, tool usage will be monitored and findings will be reviewed and evaluated. If the tools are found to be inactive or underused, access may be revoked to maintain prudence in our cost management.

Access will be rolled out progressively to [eligible roles](/eligibility.md) (e.g., Engineer, Product Manager, Designer) across selected teams. Detailed information on access and eligibility will be provided to those selected for the pilot.

Stay tuned for further updates as we continue to roll out the initiative.

## Subscription accounts

As part of this transition, some subscription accounts may be updated according to role eligibility. Subscription Admins (SAs) should be aware that while not all subscriptions will be affected, some changes may be made to align with the new eligibility structure.

SAs, please note that any licenses for eligible tools assigned to GovTechies will be moved from your account to a central GovTech  account.

If you do not already have a SHIP-HATS subscription, you will automatically be assigned license(s) for the tools relevant to your role.
